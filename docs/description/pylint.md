# Pylint

Pylint is the most comprehensive static analysis tool for Python. It is extremely thorough and is the source of most messages that prospector outputs.

## Notes on Codacy Pylint

Pylint is officially supported in Codady on it's own. If you want better configurability, we suggest to disable Pylint in Prospector and use the "Pylint (Python 3)" tool in Codacy. If you prefer, however, the Prospector default settings, you can disable the Codacy Pylint tool and use it from Prospector.
