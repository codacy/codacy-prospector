# Frosted

Frosted is a fork of pyflakes (originally created by Phil Frost) that aims at more open contribution from the outside public, a smaller more maintainable code base, and a better Python checker for all. It currently cleanly supports Python 2.6 - 3.4 using pies (https://github.com/timothycrosley/pies) to achieve this without ugly hacks and/or py2to3.
